# `project-euler-clojure`

Clojure solutions to select Project Euler problems.

## Usage

Project Euler problems sometimes provide test cases. Run them with:
``` shellsession
$ lein test
```

Print the solutions to the selected problems:
``` shellsession
$ lein run
```

This may take about 2 minutes. My solutions to problems 7 and 9 are
slightly expensive.
